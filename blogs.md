### 2026 Shuyao Own Dataset Hub

This is my 2026 Personal Knowledge & Productivity Hub, built on Notion — a curated digital workspace where I organize my research, academic projects, goals, and life systems, updated daily.

It includes: My daily reflections and thinking records, personal project and task management systems, a knowledge and tools hub, my 2026 growth goals and long-term planning.

This hub serves as both a structured database and a space for continuous learning, reflection, and self-development.
If you’re interested, please leave a massage let me know and I will open the link!
